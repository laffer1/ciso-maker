ciso-maker is a fork of the Ciso program developed by Booster and
later maintained by froom on SourceForge. 

As froom stopped maintaining the package, I've decided to apply many of the common
patches floating around to the tool and keep it going.

Current Site: http://github.com/laffer1/ciso-maker
Current Maintainer: Lucas Holt <luke@foolishgames.com>
Current Version: 1.1.1

### Usage ###

Extracting a file
./ciso-maker  -x test.cso test.iso

Compressing a file
./ciso-maker  -c test.iso foo.cso

### OS Compatibility ###

As of version 1.1.1, ciso-maker compiles on Linux with
GCC 15.2.0 and clang 19.1.7. It also builds on MidnightBSD 4.0.4 with clang 19.1.7.

Historically tested on OS X 10.10.3, FreeBSD 10.1 and MidnightBSD 0.6.
Continuous integration covers Linux and FreeBSD builds. MidnightBSD should
still be verified manually.
